[Added fight stick mode!](https://romthesheep.github.io/Arcade-Bongo-Cat/?stick=1)

Html version of ![bongocat-osu](https://github.com/kuroni/bongocat-osu) with based incorporated Greenscreen

To match your controller button configuration use the usefull website https://html5gamepad.com/codes. 
The default index contains the config for the ![brook fighting](https://www.brookaccessory.com/detail/09922855/) pcb, tho changing this is pretty simple.

Atm the only available version is an hitbox controller, maybe in the future I will implement a fight stick version if I see demand for it.

# my controller doesnt match that configuration, what do I do?

Head to https://html5gamepad.com/codes and write down your Bvalues and the position on the board. 
I've assigned this keyvalues to the values of the board:

You will have to match your Bvalues to vbX variables at the start of the js file. This is the default configuration:

# I want to use this on my OBS, how can I do it?

Create a browser source and paste your local directory on the url field like this:

then use a color key filter to clear the green background and you are good to go!

# IMPORTANT NOTE
IF YOU ARE USING A CHEAP PCB (no shame) YOU MAY NEED TO UNPLUG AND PLUG AGAIN THE CONTROLLER
